    INF   This workload is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of this device.  
          To further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 2.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 10.04 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.55 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible      
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per      
          warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 22.2 cycles being stalled waiting for the L1 instruction queue  
          for local and global (LG) memory operations to be not full. Typically, this stall occurs only when executing  
          local or global memory instructions extremely frequently. Avoid redundant global memory accesses. Try to      
          avoid using thread-local memory by checking if dynamically indexed arrays are declared in local scope, or if  
          the kernel has excessive register pressure causing spills. If applicable, consider combining multiple         
          lower-width memory operations into fewer wider memory operations and try interleaving memory operations and   
          math instructions. This stall type represents about 76.2% of the total average of 29.1 cycles between         
          issuing two instructions.

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This workload achieves an average of 24.8 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced  
          to 16.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 104 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, this partial wave may account for  
          up to 33.3% of the total runtime of this kernel. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall       
          impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid. See the Hardware   
          Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for     
          more details on launch configurations.

          The difference between calculated theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (83.3%) can be the     
          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices
